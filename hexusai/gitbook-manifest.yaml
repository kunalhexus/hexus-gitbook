    # Overview

    Hexus empowers GTM teams to enhance customer experiences with interactive product demos, walkthroughs, and how-to guides created in just a few clicks. Deliver personalized content faster across multiple formats.

    This integration allows you to embed Hexus demos directly into your Gitbook pages for easy access and visualization.

    # How it works

    Just paste a Hexus Flow or Mutliflow URL into your Gitbook documentation and the integration will automatically render it as an interactive product demo.

    # Configure
    Simply navigate to [https://app.gitbook.com/integrations/hexusai](https://app.gitbook.com/integrations/hexusai) and click the install button to get started. Choose the appropriate options in the installation flow to install Hexus in one or more spaces or across your Gitbook organization.
