    # Overview

    Hexus enables you to create interactive product demos, walkthroughs, vidoes and how to guides with just a few clicks, enabling them to learn at their own pace.

    This integration enables embedding Hexus demos, right into your Gitbook pages for easy access and visualization.

    # How it works

    Just paste a Hexus Flow or Mutliflow URL into your Gitbook documentation and the integration will automatically render it as an interactive product demo.

    # Configure
    Simply navigate to [https://www.gitbook.com/integrations/hexusai](https://www.gitbook.com/integrations/hexusai) and click the install button to get started. Choose the appropriate options in the installation flow to install Hexus in one or more spaces or across your Gitbook organization.
